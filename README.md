# recordstoregame

A fun  and simple **Game** about collecting **Vinyl** 

This **Game** is my first project using *javascript and j5*, also learning some *DOM manipulation*. It was a really fun project to make.

Its inspired on the international **Record Store Day** and **Discogs**.
The main purpose of the game is to resemble the feeling of getting some Exclusive **LTD RSD Vinyl** and while you're at it, as long as you collect the music will still play. *So keep it up!*



Use the **Arrows** to move around, and collect the **Vinyl** *before you run out of time*. 

For best resolution play with the browser on full screen and turn up the volume!
