# recordstoregame

a fun game about collecting vinyl
This game is my first project using javascript and j5, also learning some DOM manipulation. It was a really fun project to make.

Its inspired on the international Record Store Day and Discogs.
The main purpose of the game is to resemble the feeling of getting some Exclusive LTD RSD Vinyl and while you're at it, as long as you collect the music will still play. So keep it up!



Use the Arros to move around, and the click to collect. 

For best resolution play with the browser on full screen and turn up the volume!
